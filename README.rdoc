== Autobus

A mobile in-browser app that pinpoints a user's exact location, determines the nearest MTA Bus stop and delivers real-time data on when the next bus will arrive at that stop. 

This app utilizes HTML 5's geolocation feature and Javascript/jQuery, along with the New York City's MTA Bus Time API.
